dotfiles
===

Shared conf files for *nix systems. For now only used/tested on Ubuntu 11.10. The install script was inspired by [claytron](https://github.com/claytron/dotfiles/blob/0b18363607ededda85c9167d66ce57400bf2cb2a/create_links.sh)'s earlier work.

Feel free to borrow from these confs, but be warned I break expected behavior of some apps in places (for now mostly vim) so be warned.
