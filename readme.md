dotfiles
===

Shared conf files for *nix systems. For now only used/tested on Ubuntu 10.10. The install script is extended from [claytron](https://github.com/claytron/dotfiles/blob/master/create_links.sh)'s earlier work.

Feel free to borrow from these confs, but be warned I break expected behavior of some apps in places (for now mostly vim) so be warned.
